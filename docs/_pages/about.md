HurricaneLog is a serious game developed at Polytechnique Montréal by Ph.D. student Thiago Correia Pereira as part of his research project, supervised by Professors <a href="https://professeurs.polymtl.ca/daniel.aloise/">Daniel Aloise</a> and <a href="https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/marie-eve.rancourt.html">Marie-Ève Rancourt</a>.

The game simulates humanitarian logistics operations before and during Atlantic hurricane seasons. It was developed aiming to serve as a training tool for humanitarian logistics agents, as a complementary teaching tool regarding disaster preparedness and response for university students, or even as a tool to bring awareness to non-expert players regarding the importance of natural disaster preparedness. The game allows players to acquire knowledge and training directly from their interactions with the game, by observing the outcome of their actions in a safe and inexpensive way. Besides, it contains entertainment elements which are aimed to gain greater retention and learning.
